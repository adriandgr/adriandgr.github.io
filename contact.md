### Social Links

Even though I have an online presence in more sites than the ones I'm providing,
each one of these has been carefully chosen for a number of reasons.

I don't *tweet* as much as I should but I find this tool to be incredibly useful
for connecting all sorts of creative individuals. Its 140 character format and
distribution method is fast // simple // open // elegant // and encourages new connections
while providing a unique emphasis on ephemera. You may follow me at [adgr72] [1].
If you're following me right after reading this, I encourage you to also *@mention* me with the hashtag *#webart*, and I will reply back to you!

*GitHub* is a tool which I'm just
barely exploring the tip of what surely is an incredibly powerful iceberg. Not only does it provide the
backend for this website, or advanced version control features for
solo and collaborative projects, but it also connects creative individuals wishing to
share such endeavours. You may send pull requests or fork my gits at [adriandgr] [2].
<!--  
Last but not least is diaspora*, which is a social network that aims to provide a
similar toolsets than Facebook but is at its core fundamentally different. It is built
upon the ideological belief that users should be empower to have control over their
own data. Diaspora* is a distributed network and therefore does not rely on a centralized system.

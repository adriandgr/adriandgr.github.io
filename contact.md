## Contact

### I love e-mail

For all artistic and professional inquiries, please write to me at:
<pre>obj.art@adriandiaz.ca</pre>

Web-related and technical queries should find their way to:
<pre>web.art@adriandiaz.ca</pre>

Are you a computer geek like myself? Try sending me an encrypted message:
<pre>
Public Key Server -- Get ''0x0bc86d16139be368''
Hostname: pgp.mit.edu
</pre>

### Social Links

Even though I have an online presence in more sites than the ones I'm providing,
each one of these has been carefully chosen for a number of reasons. Even though
I don't *tweet* as much as I should, I find this tool to be incredibly useful
for connecting all sorts of creative individuals. It's 140 character,
open, elegant structure encourages new connections and the sharing ephemera.

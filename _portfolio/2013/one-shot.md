**One Shot** <br />
*Documentation of performance setup* <br />
2013

In this live performance, the artist creates a delineated space within the gallery,
where he carries out a series of unscripted actions. Outside of this space, a medium
format camera is left on a plinth along with a scripted set of instructions,
explaining the viewer how to operate the camera as well as a statement warning that
the performance is set to end as soon as the first image is captured.

**Le Bonheur de Vivre** <br />
*Series of 5 silver gelatin prints on 20x24in fiber based paper.* <br />
2014

Through a series digital manipulations, the artist takes Matisse's painting *Le
Bonheur de Vivre* through a journey of different color spaces (the way computers
store and think about color information). He then represents the painting five
times as different height paper stacks proportional to the varying file
sizes these transformations produce.

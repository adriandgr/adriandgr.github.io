**Picture Book** <br />
*Hand crafted slide transparencies on a relay timer with user-activated audio narration.* <br />
2014

In this interactive piece, a set of seemingly random, solid-coloured transparency
slides are projected at a constant rate. The viewer is invited to press a button, which
disrupts the timer responsible for advancing the slides and begins to play an audio narration.
Picture Book is an invitation for viewers to consider the single frame in front of them in ways
which they may not have seen before.

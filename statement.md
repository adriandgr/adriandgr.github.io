### Statement

Ridia Onzo is a performance art, photography, and installation artist.
Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded
systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the
objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through
a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.

### Bio

Growing up in Mexico City, I quickly developed an interest in the arts. I learned to play the violin since elementary, a practice which I continue to enjoy to this day. I had the transformative experience of living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil from ages 12 to 17. After completing a foundation year in Computer Science at UBC, I transferred to the Art History and Visual Art department for my BFA.

<strong>Ridia Onzo</strong> is the artistic pseudonym I began to use on January 2015 and is intended to be a unifying web and social media identity.

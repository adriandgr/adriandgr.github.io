### Bio

I grew up in Mexico City, to a family that exposed me and helped me develop a keen interest in the arts. I learned to play the violin, a practice that I
continue to enjoy to this day. I had the transformative experience of living in Sao Paulo, Brazil from ages 12 to 17.

Since 2009, I've resided in Vancouver, BC. After completing a foundation year in Computer Science, I transferred to the Art History and Visual Art department for my BFA.

<strong>Ridia Onzo</strong> is the artistic pseudonym I began to used on January 2015 and is intended to be a unifying web and social media identity.



### Statement

Ridia Onzo is a performance art, photography, and installation artist.
Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded
systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the
objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through
a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.

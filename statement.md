### Statement

Adrian Diaz is a performance art, photography, and installation artist.
Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded
systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the
objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through
a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.

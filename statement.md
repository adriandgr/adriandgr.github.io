### Bio

Born in Mexico City, Adrian Diaz grew up in this hispanic metropolitan center, where he developed a
keen interest in the arts. Since an early age he learned to play the violin, a practice he
continues to enjoy to this day. He moved with his family to Brazil from 2001 to 2006, studying at Escola
Graduada, the American school of Sao Paulo.

He has resided in Vancouver, BC since 2009. After completing a foundation year in Computer Science,
he transferred to the Art History and Visual Art department for his BFA.



### Statement

Adrian Diaz is a performance art, photography, and installation artist.
Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded
systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the
objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through
a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.
